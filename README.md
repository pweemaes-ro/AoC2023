# AoC2023

I strive to code as <b>Pythonic</b> as possible, that is, <b>understandable</b> and <b>readable</b>, <b>PEP 8 compliant</b>, and also <b>Mypy in strict mode</b> should be happy about the type annotations. This may result in slightly sub-optimal code. I also try to use only the standard 'batteries' that come with Python.

I appreciate all suggestions for improvement in performance or otherwise, as long as they keep the code pythonic.

Cheers!

PS. This is a project in progress... There is no deadline, I might stop working on it, and pick up on it in the future, or I might not...
